### ðŸ”§ Design Prompt (Question Formulation):

> **"Design and implement a low-level notification service in Python that supports multiple channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications). The system should handle message delivery with retries, batching, and prioritization, and be easily extendable to support new channels."**

---

### ðŸ§  Constraints to Keep in Mind:

* Multiple notification channels (Email, SMS, etc.)
* Retries on failure
* Message prioritization (e.g., High vs Low)
* Queueing or batching support
* Thread-safe and extensible
