## 🔁 PHASE 1: Core Production Enhancements

### ❓ Questions to Ask

* How can I support both console and file output?
* Should logs be in JSON for easier parsing by systems like ELK, Datadog?
* Do I need structured logs (with fields like service, request\_id)?
* How to ensure retention of logs (e.g., auto-delete after 7 days)?

### 🎯 Objectives

1. [ ] Add **console logging** toggle.
2. [ ] Support **structured JSON output**.
3. [ ] Implement **log retention policy** (e.g., max age or max count).
4. [ ] Add **optional fields** like request ID, component name, etc.

### 💡 Hints

* Use `json.dumps()` in `_write_to_file()` for JSON formatting.
* Create a `LogRecord` class with attributes for structured logging.
* Use `os.listdir()` and `os.path.getctime()` to delete old log files.

## 🌐 PHASE 2: Real-Time Log Streaming

### ❓ Questions to Ask

* How can logs be streamed to the frontend in real-time?
* How can multiple clients view logs simultaneously?
* How to make UI updates happen **without refresh**?

### 🎯 Objectives

1. [ ] Add a **websocket-based server** for live log streaming.
2. [ ] Buffer recent logs in memory and serve via endpoint.
3. [ ] Build a simple **frontend UI** using React/Vue/Svelte to view logs.

### 💡 Hints

* Use `FastAPI` + `WebSockets` for backend streaming.
* Use a `deque(maxlen=500)` to store recent logs in-memory.
* On each log write, emit to WebSocket clients using a broadcast channel.

## ☁️ PHASE 3: Centralized Remote Logging

### ❓ Questions to Ask

* Should logs go to a central aggregator (e.g., via TCP, HTTP)?
* What if the logger runs on multiple machines?
* How do I ensure **log delivery reliability**?

### 🎯 Objectives

1. [ ] Add support for sending logs to a **remote aggregator**.
2. [ ] Implement retry + queue buffering for remote delivery.
3. [ ] Add toggle to enable/disable remote logging per environment.

### 💡 Hints

* Send logs over HTTP using `requests.post()` (batched or single).
* Buffer logs in an internal queue and retry on failure.
* Use environment variables or config files to toggle remote mode.

## 🧠 PHASE 4: Advanced Features

### ❓ Questions to Ask

* How can I track how many logs are generated per level?
* How do I filter logs dynamically in the UI?
* Can I tag logs by component/service?

### 🎯 Objectives

1. [ ] Add **metrics tracking** (counts per log level).
2. [ ] Add **tag-based filtering** (e.g., by `service`, `hostname`).
3. [ ] Enhance UI with **search, filter, and tail log** features.

### 💡 Hints

* Maintain a `Counter` or `defaultdict` for level-wise counts.
* Include tags like `hostname`, `module`, `thread_id` in each log.
* Use a frontend table component with filters on structured fields.

## 🧪 Final Testing & Deployment

### ❓ Questions to Ask

* Have I tested for log loss under high concurrency?
* What happens if log rotation fails mid-write?
* Does my logger gracefully shutdown and flush all logs?

### 🎯 Objectives

1. [ ] Simulate high load with 1000s of log writes/sec.
2. [ ] Test disk full / permission denied scenarios.
3. [ ] Profile memory usage during long uptime.

### 💡 Hints

* Use `threading` to simulate concurrent log calls.
* Log failures to a fallback file or stderr.
* Monitor queue length, dropped messages, or backpressure triggers.

## 📈 Optional Future Ideas

* [ ] Export logs in a downloadable archive via the UI
* [ ] Integrate with Kafka for log ingestion
* [ ] Encrypt sensitive fields before writing logs
* [ ] Implement role-based access control in the UI
